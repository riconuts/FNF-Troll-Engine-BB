# The Others

## Psych Engine

Psych Engine is deader than a doornail, Psych 1.0 is left like a joke without a punchline,
A lot of changes were made in that version, despite that many of said changes were underbaked
or make it much more annoying to work with.

## NightmareVision

It's FrankenTroll, after being denied to use Troll Engine for an FNF mod, the authors glued 
stolen old outdated code together without permission to make an inferior version of it,
because nobody knows better or because the author is heavily boastful about them "making" most of it,
people don't bat an eye to it. Especially due to the authors heavily undercrediting or completely uncrediting 
people who are actually responsible for the code. And also because of them plastering the engine's name everywhere
on the boot logos of FNF mods, Because apparently a mod being on the engine isn't enough advertising.

### JULY 1ST AMENDMENT

As people found out in smaller areas in the community, the team behind NMV decided to credit the people they stole from to begin with (only afterwards mind you, meaning if nobody bat an eye to it the authors wouldn't be doing such thing in the first place but I digress).

I am still gonna highlight things that make me not want to use it though.

* The bundled base game content pack performs worse than V-Slice on lower end hardware and I am not hyperbolising. This heavily lowers my trust in the engine's performance.
* NMV has broken holds. Modcharts on NMV will look worse than if they were made on Troll instead.
* All use cases for NMV sans modcharts can be satiated by base Psych Engine to begin with. As the engine literally is just a lightly modified Psych fork. Giving me less of a reason to use it over Psych or Troll.
* I simply do not wish to learn the small discrepencies between Troll and NMV scripting, and would end up being a waste of time.
