# BBTE

Hello guys this is me burgerballs, this here is the fork i use for my fnf mods.
As troll engine is already perfect i kinda only needed to change small tiny things to make it easier for me.

As this is my own personal fork, expect bloat, this is meant to be used by nobody aside from me!

I've modified the `install_haxelibs` files, before building you should check them out.

NOTE: Do not treat this as an official release!!! This version of the engine is unendorsed by the original creators.

# QNA

Some questions might be asked about this fork in particular. So I might answer them here. 

Q: Why not PR these changes to Troll Engine

A: As a programmer I understand that what I'm doing is best described as bloat in some reigonal dialects.
It isn't best to do add changes for an engine only I use to it's base version for this reason.

Q: Why not just use X or Y Engine

A: I don't want to.

# Friday Night Funkin': Troll Engine

[Troll Engine](https://github.com/riconuts/troll-engine) is the fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) 0.5.2h originally made for the [Tails Gets Trolled mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/320596).

## NOTE:

This engine is a ****WORK IN PROGRESS****!!! 

Expect bugs, breaking changes and no documentation!!!

Compatibility with Psych Engine mods is limited and will be removed in the future.

## Features:

 - Quant note skins
 - Lots of hud customization (NPS counter, note hit timing info, colored combos, judgement counters, options for other hud styles too)
 - An awesome modchart system
 - Custom hscript implementation (scriptable notetypes, events, stages, characters and song scripts)
 - Scriptable states
 - A lot more!!!

## Installation / Requirements:

* Must have Haxe 4.3.0 or greater.

* Troll Engine's specific haxe libraries can be installed with the `haxelibs` files located in the `setup` folder.

* If this is your first time compiling a HaxeFlixel project, refer to the full [build instructions](https://github.com/riconuts/FNF-Troll-Engine/blob/main/BUILDING.md).
